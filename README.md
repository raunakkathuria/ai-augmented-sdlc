# Student Budget Tracker

A financial management application designed specifically for university students to track expenses, plan budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits.

## Project Overview

The Student Budget Tracker helps university students manage their finances effectively by providing tools to:

- Track expenses and income
- Set and monitor budgets by category
- View spending reports and insights
