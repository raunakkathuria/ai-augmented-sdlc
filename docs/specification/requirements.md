# Student Budget Tracker - Requirements

## Project Overview
A financial management application designed specifically for university students to track expenses, plan budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits.

## Target Users
University students who:
- Have limited income (scholarships, part-time jobs, parental support)
- Face unique expenses (textbooks, meal plans, housing)
- Need to develop financial literacy
- Want to maximize their limited resources

## Core Problem Statement
University students struggle to manage their finances effectively due to irregular income, variable expenses, and limited financial experience. They need a simple tool that helps them track spending, stay within budget, and develop good financial habits.

## Feature Requirements

### Must Have (Phase 1)
- Expense tracking with date, amount, category, and notes
- Income recording with source and date
- Monthly budget setting by category
- Basic reporting (current month spending, budget vs. actual)
- Data persistence (local storage)
- Simple, intuitive UI optimized for mobile

### Should Have (Phase 2)
- Visual reports and charts
- Expense trends and patterns
- Budget recommendations based on spending history
- Export functionality (CSV/PDF)
- Dark/light mode

### Could Have (Future Phases)
- Recurring transaction setup
- Bill reminders and notifications
- Photo receipt capture
- Multiple currency support
- Financial goal setting and tracking

## Constraints and Assumptions
- Mobile-first design (students primarily use smartphones)
- Offline functionality (not dependent on constant connectivity)
- Privacy-focused (financial data stays on device)
- No complex financial knowledge required from users
