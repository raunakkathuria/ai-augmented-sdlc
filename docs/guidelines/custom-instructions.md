## Core Principles

1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
   - Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering
   - If a feature can be implemented in 10 lines instead of 30, prefer the simpler approach

2. **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
   - Write tests before implementing functionality
   - Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Maintain high test coverage for all business logic

3. **Modular Code Structure**
   - One responsibility per component/function
   - Organize code into logical modules
   - Maintain clear boundaries between different parts of the application

## Implementation Checklist

For every change, ensure you:

- [ ] Follow the KISS principle - implement the simplest solution that works
- [ ] Write tests first, then implement the feature
- [ ] Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- [ ] Document your code with clear, concise comments
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
- [ ] Follow the project's coding guidelines and naming conventions
- [ ] Verify your changes work on mobile devices

## Code Review Criteria

All code reviews should verify that changes:

1. Maintain simplicity (no unnecessary complexity)
2. Include appropriate tests
3. Follow the modular structure
4. Are well-documented
5. Meet the functional requirements
