# Student Budget Tracker - MVP Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Student Budget Tracker MVP. It defines the approach, scope, and methodologies for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application.

## Testing Objectives
- Verify that all MVP features work as expected
- Ensure data persistence functions correctly
- Validate that the UI is responsive and user-friendly
- Identify and address any critical bugs or issues
- Confirm that the application meets the defined requirements

## Testing Scope

### In Scope
- Core functionality testing (transactions, budgets, reporting)
- Data persistence testing
- UI/UX testing on various screen sizes
- Basic performance testing
- Error handling and validation testing

### Out of Scope
- Extensive performance testing
- Security testing
- Accessibility testing (will be addressed in Phase 1)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond major browsers)
- Automated end-to-end testing

## Testing Approaches

### Unit Testing
Unit tests will focus on testing individual functions and components in isolation.

#### What to Test
- Storage service functions
- Context actions and reducer
- Utility functions
- Individual UI components

#### Testing Tools
- Jest for test runner and assertions
- React Testing Library for component testing

### Integration Testing
Integration tests will verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

#### What to Test
- Data flow between components
- Context integration with components
- Form submissions and state updates
- List rendering with filtered data

### Manual Testing
Manual testing will focus on user flows and overall application behavior.

#### What to Test
- Complete user journeys
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Data persistence between sessions

   - Test DELETE_CATEGORY action

### UI Components
1. **Navigation**
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Verify responsive behavior

2. **Transaction Form**
   - Test form validation
   - Test form submission
   - Test form cancellation
   - Test editing existing transaction

3. **Transaction List**
   - Test rendering transactions
   - Test filtering transactions
   - Test transaction deletion
   - Test empty state

4. **Budget Form**
   - Test form validation
   - Test form submission
   - Test form cancellation
   - Test editing existing budget

5. **Budget List**
   - Test rendering budgets
   - Test budget progress indicators
   - Test budget deletion
   - Test empty state

6. **Dashboard Components**
   - Test monthly summary calculations
   - Test budget overview rendering
   - Test data refresh

### User Flows
1. **Adding and Viewing Transactions**
   - Add a new transaction
   - Verify it appears in the transaction list
   - Verify it's reflected in the monthly summary

2. **Setting and Monitoring Budgets**
   - Create a new budget for a category
   - Add transactions for that category
   - Verify budget progress is updated correctly

3. **Viewing Reports**
   - Add various transactions
   - Navigate to reports
   - Verify summary calculations are correct
   - Verify category breakdown is accurate

4. **Data Persistence**
   - Add transactions and budgets
   - Close and reopen the application
   - Verify all data is preserved

## Error Handling Testing
1. **Form Validation**
   - Test required field validation
   - Test numeric field validation
   - Test date field validation

2. **Error Boundaries**
   - Test component error recovery
   - Verify user-friendly error messages

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with empty data sets
   - Test with large data sets
   - Test with invalid inputs

## Responsive Design Testing
1. **Mobile View**
   - Test on small screens (320px - 480px)
   - Verify all features are accessible

2. **Tablet View**
   - Test on medium screens (481px - 768px)
   - Verify layout adjusts appropriately

3. **Desktop View**
   - Test on large screens (769px and above)
   - Verify efficient use of screen space

## Testing Schedule
- Unit tests will be written alongside code development
- Integration tests will be implemented after core features are complete
- Manual testing will be conducted throughout development
- Final testing will be performed before MVP release

## Test Reporting
- Test results will be documented
- Issues will be tracked and prioritized
- Critical bugs will be addressed immediately
- Non-critical issues will be documented for Phase 1

## Success Criteria
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- No critical bugs in manual testing
- All MVP requirements are met
- Data persistence works reliably
- UI is responsive and functional on all target screen sizes
