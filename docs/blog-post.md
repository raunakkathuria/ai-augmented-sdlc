# Leveraging AI in Software Development: A Git-Based Workflow for University Projects

## Introduction

As university students, you're constantly juggling multiple projects, assignments, and deadlines. When it comes to software development projects, the challenge isn't just writing code—it's managing the entire development process efficiently. How do you ensure your project is well-structured, properly documented, and follows best practices, all while meeting tight deadlines?

Enter AI-assisted development with a structured Git workflow. This approach combines the power of modern AI tools with systematic version control to create a development process that is both efficient and educational. In this blog post, we'll explore a practical workflow that you can apply to your university projects, using a Student Budget Tracker application as our example.

## Why This Approach Works for Students

Before diving into the details, let's understand why this approach is particularly valuable for university students:

1. **Learning by doing**: You'll gain practical experience with industry-standard tools and workflows
2. **Efficient use of time**: AI helps with boilerplate code and documentation, letting you focus on core concepts
3. **Structured development**: The phased approach prevents overwhelm and keeps projects manageable
4. **Portfolio building**: The resulting projects demonstrate both technical skills and professional development practices
5. **Skill development**: You'll learn to effectively collaborate with AI tools, an increasingly valuable skill in the industry

## The Workflow Overview

Our workflow consists of four main phases:

1. **Requirements Refinement**: Documentation-first approach
2. **Quick MVP**: Rapid implementation to validate concepts
3. **Phase 1 Implementation**: Core functionality development
4. **Phase 2 Implementation**: Enhanced features and refinements

Each phase has its own Git branch, allowing for clean separation of concerns and systematic progress tracking.

## Phase 0: Requirements Refinement

### Starting with Documentation

The first phase focuses entirely on documentation. This might seem counterintuitive—shouldn't we start coding right away? However, beginning with clear documentation provides several benefits:

- Forces you to think through the problem before writing code
- Creates a roadmap for development
- Establishes clear success criteria
- Makes it easier to divide work among team members
- Provides context for AI assistance

### Key Documentation Components

For our Student Budget Tracker example, we created the following documentation:

1. **Requirements Document**: Defines what we're building and for whom
2. **Implementation Plan**: Breaks down the project into manageable phases
3. **Technical Specification**: Outlines the technology stack and architecture
4. **Coding Guidelines**: Establishes standards for code quality
5. **Git Workflow**: Defines branch strategy and commit conventions
6. **AI Collaboration Guidelines**: Establishes when and how to use AI effectively

### Using AI for Documentation

AI tools like Claude excel at helping create comprehensive documentation. Here's an effective prompt template:

```
I'm creating a [type of application] for [target users]. Please help me create a detailed [document type] that includes:

1. [Specific section]
2. [Specific section]
3. [Specific section]

The application should [key requirements].
```

For example:

```
I'm creating a budget tracking application for university students. Please help me create a detailed requirements document that includes:

1. Project overview
2. Target user description
3. Core problem statement
4. Feature requirements (must-have, should-have, could-have)
5. Constraints and assumptions

The application should help students track expenses, plan budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits.
```

### Git Operations

All documentation is committed to the main branch:

```bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: project requirement, specification and planning documents"
```

## Phase 1: Quick MVP

### Purpose of the MVP

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) phase is about quickly implementing the core functionality to:

- Validate that your technical approach works
- Identify gaps in your requirements
- Get early feedback on usability
- Discover potential challenges before full implementation

### Creating the MVP Branch

```bash
git checkout -b MVP
```

### Implementing the MVP

For our Student Budget Tracker, the MVP includes:

1. Basic expense tracking
2. Simple budget setting
3. Minimal reporting functionality
4. Local data storage
5. Basic UI

### Using AI for MVP Development

AI can significantly accelerate MVP development. Here's an effective prompt:

```
Based on the requirements in [link to requirements doc], please help me implement a minimal version of [feature] using [technology stack].

Focus on core functionality only, without advanced features or extensive error handling.
```

### Evaluating the MVP

After implementing the MVP, it's crucial to evaluate it critically:

- Does it meet the core requirements?
- What's missing or not working as expected?
- What did we learn that should inform the full implementation?

This evaluation helps refine the requirements and implementation plan before proceeding to Phase 1.

### Git Operations

Commit each feature separately:

```bash
git add src/components/ExpenseTracker.js
git commit -m "feat: implement basic expense tracking"

git add src/components/BudgetSetting.js
git commit -m "feat: add simple budget setting functionality"
```

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### Creating the Phase 1 Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b phase1/implementation
```

### Implementing Core Features

Based on the refined requirements from the MVP phase, implement the core features with proper architecture, error handling, and testing:

1. Comprehensive expense and income tracking
2. Full budget management
3. Basic reporting and insights
4. Polished UI for core functionality

### Using AI for Implementation

AI can help with specific implementation tasks:

```
Please help me implement [specific component/feature] according to our technical specification [link].

Requirements:
1. [Specific requirement]
2. [Specific requirement]
3. [Specific requirement]

Please follow our coding guidelines [link] and include appropriate tests.
```

### Git Operations

Commit each logical unit of work separately:

```bash
git add src/components/transactions/
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive transaction management"

git add src/components/budget/
git commit -m "feat: add complete budget setting and tracking"
```

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features

### Creating the Phase 2 Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b phase2/implementation
```

### Implementing Advanced Features

With the core functionality in place, Phase 2 focuses on enhancing the user experience:

1. Visual analytics and charts
2. Forecasting and trends
3. Smart recommendations
4. Quality of life improvements

### Git Operations

As with previous phases, commit each feature separately:

```bash
git add src/components/analytics/
git commit -m "feat: add visual analytics and charts"

git add src/components/forecasting/
git commit -m "feat: implement expense forecasting"
```

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration

Throughout this process, effective collaboration with AI tools is essential. Here are some best practices:

### When to Use AI

- **Effective use cases**: Documentation, boilerplate code, UI components, tests
- **Less effective use cases**: Complex business logic, system architecture, security-critical code

### Effective Prompting

1. **Be specific**: Clearly define what you want
2. **Provide context**: Include relevant information about your project
3. **Set constraints**: Specify limitations or requirements
4. **Request explanations**: Ask for reasoning behind suggestions
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on initial responses

### Reviewing AI-Generated Code

Always review AI-generated code for:

- Functionality: Does it work as expected?
- Edge cases: Are all scenarios handled?
- Performance: Are there any inefficient patterns?
- Security: Are there potential vulnerabilities?
- Maintainability: Is the code clear and well-structured?

## Conclusion

The AI-assisted Git workflow approach offers university students a powerful way to develop software projects efficiently while learning industry best practices. By combining systematic documentation, phased implementation, and strategic use of AI tools, you can create high-quality applications while building valuable skills for your future career.

Remember that AI is a tool to enhance your capabilities, not replace your learning. Use it to accelerate routine tasks, generate ideas, and learn new concepts, but always understand what the code does and why it works.

Try applying this workflow to your next university project, and you'll likely find that it not only improves your productivity but also deepens your understanding of software development principles and practices.
