- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Release Phase 2

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- Core functionality works without critical bugs
- Data persistence is reliable
- UI is navigable and functional
- Identified gaps and improvements for Phase 1

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- Users can track all expenses and income
- Users can set and monitor budgets
- Basic insights are available through simple reports
- All data persists between sessions
- UI is intuitive and responsive
- Code is well-tested and documented

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- Visual analytics provide meaningful insights
- Forecasting helps users plan ahead
- Recommendations provide actionable advice
- Overall user experience is polished and intuitive
- Performance is optimized
- Documentation is comprehensive

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Adding too many features beyond the defined phases
2. **Technical debt**: Rushing implementation without proper architecture
3. **Usability issues**: Creating features that don't meet user needs
4. **Performance problems**: Inefficient data handling with large datasets

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Strictly adhere to the phased implementation plan
2. Follow coding guidelines and conduct regular code reviews
3. Gather feedback after MVP to validate user needs
4. Implement performance testing early in development
