# Phase 1 Developer Prompt

## Project Context
You are developing a Student Budget Tracker application for university students. The application helps students track expenses, manage budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits. We are currently implementing Phase 1, which focuses on core functionality.

## Technical Context
- Frontend: React.js with Material-UI
- Storage: IndexedDB for local persistence
- State Management: React Context API + useReducer
- No backend services in Phase 1 (local-only application)

## Requirements for Phase 1
1. Implement expense and income tracking with categorization
2. Create monthly budget setting functionality by category
3. Develop basic reporting (current month summary, budget vs. actual)
4. Ensure all data persists locally between sessions
5. Design a simple, intuitive UI optimized for mobile use

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Prioritize simplicity over complex features
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Document code with clear comments
- Follow the project's coding guidelines

## Deliverables
1. Complete implementation of Phase 1 features
2. Unit and integration tests for all functionality
3. Documentation for components and functions
4. User guide for the implemented features

## Implementation Approach
Please help implement the core functionality for the Student Budget Tracker, focusing on creating a solid foundation that can be extended in future phases. The implementation should be clean, well-tested, and follow best practices for React development.
