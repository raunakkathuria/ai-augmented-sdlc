# Phase 1 Developer Prompt

## Project Context
You are developing a Student Budget Tracker application for university students. The application helps students track expenses, manage budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits. We are currently implementing Phase 1, which focuses on core functionality.

An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) has been documented in the `docs/mvp` directory. Phase 1 builds upon this MVP, enhancing the features and adding more polish to the application.

## Technical Context
- Frontend: React.js with Material-UI
- Storage: IndexedDB for local persistence
- State Management: React Context API + useReducer
- No backend services in Phase 1 (local-only application)

## Requirements for Phase 1
1. Implement expense and income tracking with categorization
   - Enhanced filtering and search capabilities
   - Transaction history with sorting options
   - Bulk operations for transactions

2. Create monthly budget setting functionality by category
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Budget history and comparison
   - Budget templates

3. Develop basic reporting (current month summary, budget vs. actual)
   - Visual charts and graphs using Chart.js
   - Expense trends over time
   - Category distribution visualization
   - Export reports as PDF/CSV

4. Ensure all data persists locally between sessions
   - Robust error handling for storage operations
   - Data backup and restore functionality
   - Data validation and integrity checks

5. Design a simple, intuitive UI optimized for mobile use
   - Polished, consistent design
   - Dark/light mode
   - Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
   - Accessibility improvements

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Prioritize simplicity over complex features
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Document code with clear comments
- Follow the project's coding guidelines

## Deliverables
1. Complete implementation of Phase 1 features
2. Unit and integration tests for all functionality
3. Documentation for components and functions
4. User guide for the implemented features
5. Performance optimization report

## Implementation Approach
Please help implement the Phase 1 functionality for the Student Budget Tracker, building upon the MVP documentation in the `docs/mvp` directory. The implementation should be clean, well-tested, and follow best practices for React development.

- [MVP Technical Specification](../mvp/technical-specification.md)
- [MVP Implementation Plan](../mvp/implementation-plan.md)
- [MVP Testing Strategy](../mvp/testing-strategy.md)
- [MVP User Guide](../mvp/user-guide.md)

### Implementation Steps
1. Review the MVP documentation to understand the foundation
2. Implement the core functionality as defined in the MVP
3. Enhance and extend the MVP features to meet Phase 1 requirements
4. Add polish and refinements to create a production-ready application
5. Ensure comprehensive testing and documentation

The goal of Phase 1 is to deliver a fully functional, polished application that provides real value to university students for managing their finances effectively.
