# MVP Evaluation Prompt

## Context
We have implemented an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the Student Budget Tracker based on the documentation in the `docs/mvp` directory. This MVP includes basic implementations of the core features planned for Phase 1. We need to evaluate this MVP to identify gaps, issues, and areas for improvement before proceeding with the full Phase 1 implementation.

## MVP Documentation References
- [MVP Requirements](../mvp/requirements.md)
- [MVP Technical Specification](../mvp/technical-specification.md)
- [MVP Implementation Plan](../mvp/implementation-plan.md)
- [MVP Testing Strategy](../mvp/testing-strategy.md)
- [MVP User Guide](../mvp/user-guide.md)

## MVP Features Implemented
1. Basic expense tracking
   - Add, edit, and delete expense transactions
   - Record essential transaction details (amount, category, date, type, notes)
   - View list of transactions
   - Basic filtering by transaction type

2. Simple budget setting
   - Set monthly budget amounts by category
   - View current budget allocations
   - Basic editing of budget amounts
   - Simple comparison of budget vs. actual spending

3. Minimal reporting functionality
   - Current month summary (total income, expenses, balance)
   - Basic category breakdown of expenses
   - Simple budget vs. actual comparison

4. Local data storage
   - Persist all user data between sessions using IndexedDB
   - Basic CRUD operations for transactions, budgets, and categories

5. Basic UI
   - Simple, intuitive interface
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Essential navigation between main sections
   - Minimal but functional styling

## Evaluation Request
Please review the MVP implementation and provide feedback on the following aspects:

### Functionality
- Are all core features working as expected according to the MVP requirements?
- Are there any critical features missing from the MVP that were specified in the requirements?
- Are there any bugs or issues that need to be addressed before proceeding to Phase 1?
- Is the data persistence working reliably across sessions?

### User Experience
- Is the UI intuitive and easy to use for the target audience (university students)?
- Are there any friction points in the user journey that need to be addressed?
- Is the application responsive and functional on various screen sizes?
- Does the application provide sufficient feedback to users during interactions?

### Technical Implementation
- Does the code structure follow the architecture outlined in the technical specification?
- Is the code modular, maintainable, and following best practices?
- Are there any performance concerns that need to be addressed?
- Is the data model sufficient for current needs and extensible for Phase 1 enhancements?
- Are there any security considerations that need to be addressed?

### Testing
- Are the existing tests comprehensive and covering critical functionality?
- Are there any areas that need additional test coverage?
- Do all tests pass consistently?

### Documentation
- Is the existing documentation clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date?
- Does the code include appropriate comments and documentation?
- What additional documentation is needed before proceeding to Phase 1?

## Improvement Recommendations
Based on your evaluation, please provide specific recommendations for:
1. Features that need refinement or completion before proceeding to Phase 1
2. UI/UX improvements that would enhance the user experience
3. Code refactoring or restructuring to improve maintainability
4. Additional tests or validation to ensure reliability
5. Documentation updates or additions

## Transition to Phase 1
Please also evaluate the MVP's readiness for transition to Phase 1:
- Which MVP components provide a solid foundation for Phase 1 enhancements?
- Which areas will require significant refactoring or redesign in Phase 1?
- What are the highest priority enhancements to focus on first in Phase 1?

Your feedback will guide our refinement of the MVP and inform our approach to the full Phase 1 implementation as outlined in the [Phase 1 Developer Prompt](phase-one-prompt.md) and the [MVP to Phase 1 Implementation Strategy](../transitions/mvp-to-phase1.md).
