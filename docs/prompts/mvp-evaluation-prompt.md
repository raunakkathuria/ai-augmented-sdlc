# MVP Evaluation Prompt

## Context
We have implemented an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the Student Budget Tracker. This MVP includes basic implementations of the core features planned for Phase 1. We need to evaluate this MVP to identify gaps, issues, and areas for improvement before proceeding with the full Phase 1 implementation.

## MVP Features Implemented
1. Basic expense tracking
2. Simple budget setting
3. Minimal reporting functionality
4. Local data storage
5. Basic UI

## Evaluation Request
Please review the MVP implementation and provide feedback on the following aspects:

### Functionality
- Are all core features working as expected?
- Are there any critical features missing from the MVP?
- Are there any bugs or issues that need to be addressed?

### User Experience
- Is the UI intuitive and easy to use?
- Are there any friction points in the user journey?
- Does the application meet the needs of university students?

### Technical Implementation
- Is the code structure clean and maintainable?
- Are there any performance concerns?
- Is the data model sufficient for current and future needs?
- Are there any security considerations that need to be addressed?

### Documentation
- Is the existing documentation clear and comprehensive?
- What additional documentation is needed?

## Improvement Recommendations
Based on your evaluation, please provide specific recommendations for:
1. Features that need refinement or completion
2. UI/UX improvements
3. Code refactoring or restructuring
4. Additional tests or validation
5. Documentation updates

Your feedback will guide our refinement of the MVP and inform our approach to the full Phase 1 implementation.
